# Django-Site
Django site that has a admin section that filters posts by elements and allows addition of posts as well.
A client side with the url of localhost.../polls/  , locoalhost.../polls/1/result , and localhost.../polls/1/vote
This is a spin off the django documentation blog type web app but with some of my styling and tweaking.
